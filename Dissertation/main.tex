% This template was written by John Davies <john.davies@glasgow.ac.uk> 2017-02-06
% It matches the university specification at the time of writing
%   for the widths of the page margins and one-and-a-half line spacing
% You may want to include more packages, particularly for heavy mathematics
% Please let me know if you find any errors or wish to suggest improvements

\documentclass[12pt,titlepage,oneside]{book}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} % modern encoding
% Comment out the next three lines of LaTeX if you wish to use Computer Modern fonts
%   (this is the default for LaTeX)
% Make sure that your TeX installation can produce good pdf with these fonts.
% The following three lines are a good alternative if you don't use much mathematics
\usepackage{mathptmx}  % uses Times for text and mathematics
\usepackage[scaled]{helvet} %  helvetica for sanserif, scaled 95% by default
\usepackage{courier}  % courier for typewriter font, pretty ugly but available
% otherwise the stix package offers more options and symbols
% \usepackage{stix}  % uses Times for text and a range of fonts for mathematics
% End of choices for fonts
\usepackage{graphicx}  % standard package for importing graphics files
\usepackage{cite}  % improves format of numerical citations, such as [1-3]
\usepackage[top=1.8cm, bottom=1.8cm,left=4.0cm,right=1.5cm]{geometry}
% These margins are the university guidelines
\usepackage[onehalfspacing]{setspace}  % gives one-and-a-half line spacing
% doublespacing is another option and can be changed in the text
