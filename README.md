# Automatic-Videography-of-Audio-Tracks-of-Songs

This following repository contains a prototype automatic videography generation system. More specifically, given any YouTube video of a song, the system automatically retrieves a set of images that are related to each line of the song, and inserts these images in an automatically created video track seeking to align these images with the background audio. 

### Prerequisite

* [Python v3.8.12](https://www.python.org/)
    * Created and tested in this version
* [PyTesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract)
    * Must install [Google Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract#installing-tesseract) such that ``` tesseract ``` can be invoked on the terminal.
* [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
    * Must be the most up to date version avalable.
        1. To check, open chrome and open More.
        2. Then go to Help, open About Google Chrome.
        3. Under About Chrome, check if there is an update available and download it if so.
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
    * Should be able to run on command line within virtual environment outlined below.

### Installation and Running

Open bash terminal and navigate to workspace folder. 

```bash
cd ~/<path>
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewParker770/Automatic-Videography-of-Audio-Tracks-of-Songs.git
```

Create python virtual environment, activate it, and download the modules used by the project:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
```bash
. venv/Script/activate
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
cd django_videography_project
```
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Terminal output should prompt to open browser and access [local host.](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)


### Collections

The system may store videos internally during the video generation process, however these videos (as well as any file made during its creation) are deleted once another video is generated. This is in part to prevent excessive files being stored, however this is mainly due to the issue of storing vidoes which are based on copyrighted content such as much music is.

However, collections for demonstartion purposes 

[COllections can be made this way]

If a collection has been provided
